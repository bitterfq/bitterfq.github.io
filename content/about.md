## Hey, I'm Aman

I’m a **Data Engineer** focused on **backend systems, data infrastructure, and automation**.  
Right now I work at a stealth startup, building tools that make data systems faster, simpler, and more reliable.

## What I Do

I spend most of my time:
- learning and experimenting with new systems
- building and maintaining **data and backend infrastructure**  
- contributing to **open-source projects** when I can  

I care about designing systems that are clear, scalable, and don’t break under pressure.

## Outside of Work

When I’m not building or debugging, I’m usually **hiking around Northern California, taking photos, or training Muay Thai**.  
Those are the things that keep me balanced and curious.
