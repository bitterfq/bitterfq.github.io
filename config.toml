I’m a **Data Engineer** who builds things that make data actually useful from real-time systems
to infrastructure that scales.

I’ve worked on projects with **Meta** and **The Nature Conservancy**,
and now I’m focused on building reliable data systems at a stealth startup.

If you want to follow along with an engineer learning as he goes, this might be a place for you.

Outside of work I’m usually **hiking around Northern California, taking photos, or training Muay Thai**.
